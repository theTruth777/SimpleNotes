Very Simple HTML5 Hybrid App for storing personal notes

SimplesNotes is a very simple HTML5 hybrid app, built by me for storing personal notes on my android phone, because I was not satisfied with existing soloutions and liked to gain some experience with the Onsen-UI Framework.

As of now (december 2018) the application is not completed.

For building the app for android I simply used Cordova.
